## Raetha Fork Details
This fork has modifications to support Pulse Audio and ALSA dmix/dsnoop in order to allow multiple applications to play/record audio at once. It may not be compaible with the stock Volumio3-OS and may require that fork which has migrated to Debian/RaspberryPiOS Bullseye. Please do not seek assistance from the Volumio staff and community as this is unsupported.

## What is Volumio

Volumio is a Free and Open Source Linux Distribution, designed and fine-tuned exclusively for music playback. It runs on a variety of devices, typically small and cheap computers like the Raspberry PI, but also on low power PCs, notebooks or thin clients.

By flashing (installing) Volumio on any of this platforms, it will then become an headless Audiophile Music Player. Headless means that the only way to control it will be with another Mobile phone, computer or tablet.

This is made possible by Volumioâ€™s UI: a web applications that runs on any device with a browser, and that allows an easy and intuitive control of your playback sessions. All communications between the webapp and Volumio will happen trough your home network.

## What's in this repo
